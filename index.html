					<h1>How do we put things on screens?<br />How could we do it in a less terrible way?</h1>
					<p>When we look at a document on a screen, we're usually looking at them in a browser. This can mean a webpage on your computer. Or it can mean that same webpage on your phone. Or it could mean what’s shown in an app on your phone or your computer. Usually when we design for the screen, we're designing for a browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					This presentation is about exactly how things get from your artboards to the browser, which might seem to be a very boring kind of magic: after you hand off a design &amp; it eventually comes back as a webpage, maybe in a slightly mangled state. What has happened?</p>
				<p> 
					Basically your design has been transformed into something called CSS, which is a set of instructions for the browser on how to display all the parts of the design. This isn’t the only way this could happen! Conisder an alternative: we could just export whatever’s in Sketch as a single enormous image and put that in the browser. But the downsides of that are pretty clear:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We might want different parts of a page to change when the user does something.</li>
						<li>We might want the page to work on both a tiny phone and an enormous monitor.</li>
						<li>Image files are a lot bigger than just text, and a webpage made that way would be really slow.</li>
					</ul>
				</p><p>
					So we don't usually do that.</p>
					<p>Instead, we make a bunch of instructions in CSS, which say things like “make this piece of text red and have it appear in 24-point Futura”. There are a lot of places to learn about that if you're really interesteed. But what I want to talk about today is something called the block model, which is the core of how a layout becomes a web page. The block model has been changing pretty radically in the past few years, and that will allow us to design new kinds of layouts. And that’s why it might be important to know a little bit about it at a high level.</p>

						<h2>A sample document</h2>
						<p>This document has 9 blocks in it. Note that all the blocks are as wide as the document is – if you resize the window, the paragraphs will reflow. The only thing that has a constant size is the image. The left margin of everything stays the same, but the distance from the top may change depending on the size of the screen. Sometimes the layout looks nice; sometimes it does not look nice.</p></div>

							<h1>This is the main header</h1>
							<p>Here is my first paragraph of text. Look how it goes on and on and on. Here is my first paragraph of text. It goes on and on and on. Here is my first paragraph of text. It is still going on and on and on. Here is my first paragraph of text. </p>
							<p>Here is the second paragraph of text. Look how short it is!</p>
							<div class="demo_image"></div>
							<p>Here is the third paragraph of text, after a break for that lovely image. The length of this paragraph: <strong>moderate</strong>. That bold word is called a <em>span</em>. (Those italic words are too.)</p>
							<ul>
								<li>• First list item</li>
								<li>• Second list item. If this keeps going all the way to the right margin, it will wrap around like a regular paragraph.</li>
								<li>• Third list item. These bullets don’t look right.</li>
							</ul>

					<div class="text">
						<h1>The concept of the block model</h1>
						<p>When browsers started, the web was very slow and therefore most of it was text. Text happens to be something that computers are good at dealing with: text is mostly linear, and computers are <em>very</em> linear. Text is mostly one-dimensional: a line from start to finish. To a computer a word is a sequence of letters; a sentence is a sequence of words; and a paragraph is a sequence of sentences. And so on and so on. It’s pretty easy to lay out text: by default the first thing appears at the top of the page, the next thing appears beneath that, and so on, and so on. </p>
						<p>The basic model for how documents appear in a browser is made up of <strong>blocks</strong>, a word that seems to have been selected for its meaninglessness: basically, it's a container that might have text in it, or it might have something else, including other containers. A document is a block and inside of that are more blocks. A paragraph is a block. A header is a block. An image would be a block.</p>
						<p>There are defaults built into browsers for how these should be displayed. If you give it a paragraph or text, it’s as wide as the width of the screen; if you give the browser an image, the height and width is the same as the size of the image itself. If you put an image between two paragraphs, the image will appear on the left, there will be empty space to its right, and the next paragraph will appear below it.</p>
						<p>Something that’s a little more complicated is a list, which is a block with blocks in it. The list is a block. And inside of it, each bullet point is also a block. 
						</p><p>
						You can also have non-blocky things inside blocks: if a stretch of text is bold or italic, it will be displayed differently from the surrounding text. These are called spans and they behave a little differently, but we won’t worry about them right now.
						</p><p>The browser lays out all the blocks that it’s given in a straight line from top to bottom. This is fine if you’re talking about something like a privacy policy which is just straight text. But for most other things, you want to have more control. So that’s where CSS comes in. CSS lets us specify where and how a block should be placed. </p>
						<p>Let’s take a quick trip through the history of CSS in browers.</p>

						<h1>The original block model</h1>
						<p>The original block model in CSS was not wonderful, though it does give you a lot of options. You can give a block a width and a height. A block can be positioned in the regular document flow, relative to another block, relative to the document as a whole, or relative to the user’s window. Many different layouts can be made this way, though the code that’s required might get very complicated.</p>
						<p>Designers wasted an immense amount of time trying to make layouts with sidebars and footers that didn’t break on different browsers. Another problem was that different browsers handled things differently.</p>
						<p>But you could, with a lot of work, make pixel-perfect layouts. The problem turned out to be the idea of pixel-perfect.</p>

					<nav><h2>Responsive two-column design</h2>
						<p>Make the window narrower or wider to see how this design reshapes itself to fit the available space. (Or drag the <span class="circle">⇲</span> icon.) It’s not perfect – the image doesn't change size for very small screens – but it does a better job of making sure that the content is always visible.</p>
						<p>But note also how wildly different the layout can be! Imagine how weird it might look if the purple area were meant to be a image: designers end up using abstract images that can work at any size or crop.</p>

						<h1>The idea of responsive design</h1>
						<p>A big problem with the classic CSS model came to light when people started using phones and tablets to look at the web: suddenly, everyone was looking at the same page in radically differently sized screens. Something that works on a 1024px screen might not work at all on a 320px iPhone screen. So the answer to this was to make the CSS more complicated by adding rules for different sizes. A page might be displayed one way if you’re on a desktop and another way if you’re on a phone.</p>
						<p>This meant more work for designers. The idea of design changed: instead of making a perfect layout for the perfect screen, it became making something that worked for all screens, at least a little.</p>

						<h1>Flexbox &amp; constraint-based design</h1>
						<p>One problem with the basic box model was that essentially that the size and position of each block is basically independent: it could relate to the container block, but that’s about it. So if, like in the last example, you had a main text column next to a sidebar, you could say “make the main text area 75% of the page width, and the sidebar 25%," and you could add a lot of rules about what happened when the screen width was below a certain size. But that meant you had a lot of rules to keep track of.</p>
						<p>The next thing to come along in CSS was the idea of the <strong>flexbox</strong>, which actually came from people making apps. A flexbox is a container that lets blocks inside of it get bigger and smaller relative to each other. If you had a flexbox around a main text area and a sidebar, you could let both of them increase in size as the window gets bigger, or just one of them. Like before, blocks are related to their parent box, but now they are also related to their sibling blocks.</p>
						<p>This allows us to start making proportional designs. It also makes it very easy to make card-style layouts. One of the things it encouraged was to start thinking about webpages in terms of <strong>components</strong>, chunks of a page that look (and behave) the same way.</p>
						<p>One constraint of the flexbox model is that it’s essentially linear. You can have a row of boxes or you can have a column of boxes. Or you could put a row of boxes inside of a column of boxes (or vice versa), which lets you make a grid.</p>
						<p>Flexbox is a powerful system. It lets you make a lot of different designs. But the code can get complicated, especially because things can look wildly different on different sized and shaped screens. This might be why a lot of flexbox-based design feels very component-y: it focuses on making sure that a small chunk of the page works correctly, no matter where it is, rather than having a sense of <em>mise-en-page</em>.</p>

						<h1>CSS Grid: the basics</h1>
						<p>The latest thing to come around is something called <strong>CSS&nbsp;Grid</strong>, which is basically an attempt to implement a new system that does things correctly, rather than the current cobbled-together mish-mash of design systems. And it does so by using the idea of a grid. The grid that it implements is stretchy, like a flexbox; but it’s also two-dimensional. And the idea of adapting to different screen sizes is baked in.</p>
						<p>The advantage on the developer side is pretty immediate: with a little forethought, it takes a lot less code to make more complicated layouts that don’t fall apart when the window is resized. Another benefit is that we can do a lot more with positioning with just CSS without falling back on JavaScript.</p>
						<p>What’s useful to the designer is that it makes it possible to use a much wider variety of layouts that have traditionally been used on the web. But also: a lot of design starts from a grid. Now that grid can be explicitly part of the implementation of the design, rather than a framework that’s mostly taken away.</p>

					<h1>Deeper into CSS Grid</h1>
					<p>
						One thing that’s new in CSS Grid is the ability to explicitly place things at a position on a grid. While this could be faked before, it was considerably more complicated to make things stay where they should be.
					</p>
					<p>What this lets us do is to say how things should be in different layouts. We can use radically different layouts for different screen sizes. What's different now is that mostly we’re only making changes to the underlying grid, not to the components themselves.</p>
